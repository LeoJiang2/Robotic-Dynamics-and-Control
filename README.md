# ME446Spring23

This project was the final project for the class ME 446: Robot Dynamics and Control. The goal of the project was to program the Thermo Scientific CRS Robot arm to move a peg attached to its end effector through three challenges. First, the peg needs to be inserted into a vertically oriented hole. Next, it needs to travel through a 3D-printed zig-zag obstacle. Finally, it needs to press down on top of an egg with between 500 and 1000 grams of force.
